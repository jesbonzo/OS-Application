                            <h1>Operating System - Overview</h1>
                         
                            <p>An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.</p>
                            <p>Some popular Operating Systems include Linux, Windows, OS X, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc.</p>

                            <h3>Definition</h3>

                            <p>An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs.</p>

                            <p><b>Following are some of important functions of an operating System:</b></p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Memory Management</li>
                              <li>Processor Management</li>
                              <li>Device Management</li>
                              <li>File Management</li>
                              <li>Security</li>
                              <li>Control over system performance</li>
                              <li>Job accounting</li>
                              <li>Error detecting aids</li>
                              <li>Coordination between other software and users</li>
                           </ul>

                           <h2>Memory Management</h2>
                           <p>Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address.</p>
                           <p>Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it must in the main memory. An Operating System does the following activities for memory management −</p>

                           <ul>
                             <li>Keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., what part of it are in use by whom, what part are not in use.</li>
                             <li>In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.</li>
                             <li>Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.</li>
                             <li>De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has been terminated.</li>
                           </ul>

                            <h2>Processor Management</h2>
                            <p>In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the processor when and for how much time. This function is called <b>process scheduling.</b> An Operating System does the following activities for processor management −</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Keeps tracks of processor and status of process. The program responsible for this task is known as <b>traffic controller.</b></li>
                              <li>Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.</li>
                              <li>De-allocates processor when a process is no longer required.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Device Management</h2>
                            <p>An Operating System manages device communication via their respective drivers. It does the following activities for device management −</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Keeps tracks of all devices. Program responsible for this task is known as the <b>I/O controller.</b></li>
                              <li>Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.</li>
                              <li>Allocates the device in the efficient way.</li>
                              <li>De-allocates devices.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>File Management</h2>
                            <p>A file system is normally organized into directories for easy navigation and usage. These directories may contain files and other directions.</p>
                            <p>An Operating System does the following activities for file management −</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Keeps track of information, location, uses, status etc. The collective facilities are often known as <b>file system.</b></li>
                              <li>Decides who gets the resources.</li>
                              <li>Allocates the resources.</li>
                              <li>De-allocates the resources.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Other Important Activities</h2>
                            <p>Following are some of the important activities that an Operating System performs −</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li><b>Security</b> − By means of password and similar other techniques, it prevents unauthorized access to programs and data.</li>
                              <li><b>Control over system performance</b> − Recording delays between request for a service and response from the system.</li>
                              <li><b>Job accounting</b> − Keeping track of time and resources used by various jobs and users.</li>
                              <li><b>Error detecting aids</b> − Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error detecting aids.</li>
                              <li><b>Coordination between other softwares and users</b> − Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers and other software to the various users of the computer systems.</li>
                            </ul>
